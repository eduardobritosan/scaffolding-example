# Scaffolding class example

## Create a development environment

After confirming that Node.js is installed in our development machine, we create the basic directory structure of an empty dist folder, an empty build folder, a src folder with three subfolders, assets, css, js, and an index.html. This can easily be done through the following terminal command

```
mdkir -p dsi-p1-parcel-eduardobritosan/src/{css,js,assets}
```

## Initialize Git and NPM and add node_modules to .gitignore

Following the last step, we'll initialize Git with the usual commands
```
git init
git remote add origin repo-url
```

After that, we'll create the .gitignore and the README.md. 

Having finished the starting Git configurations, our next step is initializing NPM. We'll do that through

```
npm init -y
```

## Install Parcel. Globally or in the project? If project based, what should be taken into account?

## Create the following NPM scripts: dev, build, deploy

## Install ESLint and Prettier
